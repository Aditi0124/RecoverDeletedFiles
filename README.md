# Scope of the Project :
The scope of this project was limited to recovering deleted files and directories, images from our own system that were deleted within the last three months. We did not explore recovering files from external hard drives or other storage devices.
We used Recuva, a free and open source data recovery software, to perform the recovery. We focused on understanding the interface and functionality of Recuva, as well as the process of scanning and recovering files.
We also generated a report on our findings, which included a detailed analysis of the recovered files. The report provided information such as the file name, file type, size, and condition of the recovered files.
This project was intended to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of open source data recovery software in recovering deleted files and directories, images. It aimed to show that with the right tools and techniques, it is possible to recover important files that may have been accidentally deleted.

Recuva uses advanced algorithms to search for and recover files that have been deleted or lost due to various reasons, such as accidental deletion, formatting, system crashes, and virus attacks. The software can recover a variety of file types, including photos, videos, documents, and emails.
One of the key features of Recuva is its user-friendly interface, which makes it easy for users to navigate and recover their lost data. The software also provides a deep scan option, which can recover files that have been overwritten or damaged.
Recuva is available in both a free and paid version. The free version provides basic features, while the paid version, called Recuva Professional, provides additional features such as virtual hard drive support, automatic updates, and premium support.
Overall, Recuva is a reliable and effective data recovery software that can help users recover lost or deleted files. However, it is important to note that no data recovery software can guarantee a 100% recovery rate, and some files may be permanently lost.#
